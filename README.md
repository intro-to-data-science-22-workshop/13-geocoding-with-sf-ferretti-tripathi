# Geocoding with SF

## Summary

This repository provides materials for a session that is part of the [I2DS Tools for Data Science workshop](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-22-workshop) run at the [Hertie School](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/), Berlin in November 2022. The student-run workshop is part of the course [Introduction to Data Science](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-22) taught by Simon Munzert at the Hertie School, Berlin, in Fall 2022.

## Session contents
The session gives an introduction to geocoding and spatial analysis. It provides insights on how to perform spatial analysis in R with the Simple Features (sf) package. 

## Main learning objectives
- Intro to geocoding (main concepts) 
- Intro to the SF package and how to use some of it s main functions)
- Visualization (plotting with SF)
